In this project, I developed an end-to-end data solution by integrating data from multiple sources such as CSV files, APIs, and SQL Server databases. I used SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to configure ETL packages that extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) data from OLTP systems into a staging environment and eventually into the data warehouse.

I then configured data marts for key business functions, including logistics, purchasing, sales, and human resources, using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). This involved creating both tabular and multidimensional models to optimize data analysis. I designed and implemented a reporting system using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to support the business's reporting needs.

Additionally, I connected the SSAS tabular models to Tableau for advanced data visualization and analysis, developing comprehensive dashboards and stories to present insights effectively to stakeholders.
